## Distros
OS based on Linux Kernel: Debian, Fedora, Arch, etc.

My current OS in use
* [Ubuntu 20.04 LTS](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/) - maybe the most popular Debian based distribution
* [Manjaro i3](https://manjaro.org/downloads/community/i3/) - my favorite with a well riced i3wm by default

## Installation
* [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) only available on windows used to create a bootable USB driver
* Partition: reference for [general schemes](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PartitioningSchemes) and [well-written guide](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/installation-guide/amd64/install.en.pdf)
