<em>Customized i3</em>
</p>

## Installation
* Old version from Ubuntu official repository
```shell
sudo apt install i3
```
This brings you i3-wm, i3status and i3lock.

* Latest version from third-party repository, see [here](https://i3wm.org/docs/repositories.html)

## Ricing
Default configuration file is located in /etc/i3 - something you could learn as beginner. User config file is in ~/.config/i3 - tweak as you want.

### Workspaces
* Move to workspace: **mod key** + workspace number
* Move focused container to workspace
* Assign applications on specific workspace

### Keyboard bindings
Bind keys to make i3 execute a command.

For example, this command simply kills the focused window.
```sh
bindsym $mod+q kill
```
### i3bar
Workspace bar is configured by a `bar` block with the following choices:  
* i3status
  ```console
  bar {
      status_command i3status
  }
  ```
* i3blocks
* polybar

i3status is handy because it comes with i3 - simple and satisfy all my needs.

The i3status config file is associated with the command.
```console
bar {
    status_command i3status --config ~/.i3status.conf
}
```
Comment out undesired widgets
```c
# order += "ipv6"

order += "volume master"
# order += "load"
# order += "memory"
order += "tztime local"
```
Awesome fonts used to customized workspace name.

```
[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - icon set
