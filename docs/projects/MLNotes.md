## Definition

learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P

Goal: its P on T improves with E

## Classification

* Supervised - "right answers" given(a set of known data points)
* Unsupervised

## Two examples of supervised  learning
* House price predication - Regression
	* Predict continuous valued output (price)
	* No real discrete delineation
* breast cancer as malignant or benign based on tumour size - Classification
  	* might have many features  -> able to deal with an infinite number of features
  	* Support Vector Machine could deal with the above problem

## Examples of unsupervised  learning
data is unlabored e.g. we dont know if cancer if malignant or not - <em>Clustering</em>
* Google news uses clustering algortihm -> bundle news with the same topic together
* Genomics - > run algorithm to cluster individuals into types of people
* Social network analysis
* Market segmentation: customer data 

## Cocktail party problem - similar to ELEC 4601 
Lots of overlapping voices

## Mode Representation

## Cost Function
two methods to look into

* assume  theta _0 = 0
* surface plot/ contour plots

## Gradient descent algorithm
