## Matching patches: **descriptors**!
Why do we need feature descriptors? What is wrong with distance metricï¼š 

$$\sum_{x,y} [I(x+u, y+v)-I(x, y)]^{2}$$

Just use the pixel values of the patch!

Fine iff geometry and appearance is unchanged.

<!--  we must determine which features come from corresponding locations in different images.
Corner detector does not the degree of overlap between two patches. it just look for good corners. -->
