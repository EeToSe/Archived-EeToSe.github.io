I was a huge fan of CCG - Collectable Card Game. I had Hearthstone, Gwent and Lor under belt with Heathstone hitting legendary and Gwent into Pro Rank.
I usally wasted the whole summer vacation playing these games for extra cosmetics like 1000 ranked wins with Demon Hunter or some Gwent border/title.
After ricing my i3wm, I realised how retarded I was to do so becasuse essentially all my efforts were just changing some values in the database.
 Nothing really changed - code remained the same, algorithm stayed unchanged and this is using human's desire of collection with some frontend tricks. And I was so fool to fall into it again and again. 


What is worse is the core game desgin. Hearthstone or Randonstone is full of RNG, which means you may lose to the opponent even though you outplayed him and that required large amount of time hiitting 
top rank in order to enter competitive series. Although competitive players may still manage to stand out, I just do not think it is wise to invest so much in this. Someone may argue it is such a glory
of becoming "World Champion". OK, fine, then let us really talk about the game model. Take Hearthstone as example, the attack sequence is one of the core problems.

Look at a simple math model here - two players have the same minions in hand. The player who go first (No.1) play 1/1. The player who go second(No.2) follow a 1/1.
No.1 now play 2/2, he could choose to trade his 1/1 with the opponents' or go face - he goes for face whola 1 damage. No.2 play 2/2, he had the same choices as No.1. 
If he dont trade, he would eventually lose becasue of going second. Else he trade, still lose. See? No.2 acutally dont have the option of choice. Hearthstone tried to play around this by adding coin, taunt 
and Aoe - which did not completely solve the game. Lor is much smaerter by adding another - block which means all your minions are taunts, this nearly provided the equal rights of minion trade. 
As a result, Lor 50-50. Game theroy problem, they are not given the same opportunities
