## Hash Tables

**Hashing**: key-value pairs using **array* by doing arithmetic operations to transform keys into array indices
1. Compute a hash function -> transform the search key into an array index. Ideally, different keys map to different indices
2. In reality, 2+ keys match to the same index -> we need *collision-resolution* to deal with this situation.

### Hash functions

### Hashing with separate chaining

### Hashing with linear probing
