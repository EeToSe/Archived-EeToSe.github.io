### Essence of Linear Algebra
<u>Geometric intuition</u>: an introduction to [visualizing](https://www.3blue1brown.com/topics/linear-algebra) what matrices are really doing

### Ten key points from Gilbert
Here are key computations and some of the ideas behind them:

1. Solving Ax = b for square systems by elimination (pivots, multipliers, back substitution, invertibility of A, factorization into A = LU)
2. Complete solution to Ax = b (column space containing b, rank of A, nullspace of A and special solutions to Ax = 0 from row reduced R)
3. Basis and dimension (bases for the four fundamental subspaces)
4. Least squares solutions (closest line by understanding projections)
5. Orthogonalization by Gram-Schmidt (factorization into A = QR)
6. Properties of determinants (leading to the cofactor formula and the sum over all n! permutations, applications to inv(A) and volume)
7. Eigenvalues and eigenvectors (diagonalizing A, computing powers A^k and matrix exponentials to solve difference and differential equations)
8. Symmetric matrices and positive definite matrices (real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, tests for xâ€™Ax > 0, applications)
9. Linear transformations and change of basis (connected to the Singular Value Decomposition - orthonormal bases that diagonalize A)
10. Linear algebra in engineering (graphs and networks, Markov matrices, Fourier matrix, Fast Fourier Transform, linear programming)
